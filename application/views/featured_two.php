			Earlier today I took my kids out to the park to have a picnic, then we were going to go for

			a walk around the lake, which is not very far from the park. We finally find a spot to setup

			our picnic, and as we are setting up my daughter looks up and sees a blanked of robins

			flying over us, but since there were so many of them all at once it seemed like it was a

			constant black cloud that wasn't ever going to move. After about 2 minutes of solid flying,

			all of the robin seemed to pass, but boy were we wrong. After about a 5 minute window,

			they came back for a round two of their fly over...but only this time, they decided to land,

			which made my daughter jump up and run, and gave me no choice but to run after her.

			As soon as I catch up to her, I turn around to walk back to our picnic spot, but as soon as

			I look up. The robin already had plans on destroying our picnic setup, and finishing our

			lunch before we could even take our first bite.

			As disappointing as that was, we packed up what was left of our belongings, and ended

			up grabbing a hotdog on a stick from a food truck at the park. As upset as my daughter

			was, it did give us a good laugh over dinner. We ended the day with going to a nice

			restaurant on the water, where I could make up for the upsetting picnic by indulging in a

			juicy steak with mashed potatoes, which were served on a warm dish that was heated to

			the perfect temperature, which kept my steak from not being overcooked, and my mashed

			potatoes from not overflowing into my vegetables, which would have just called for a

			horrible evening, and just a terrible day all together.
