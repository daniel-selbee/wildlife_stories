			During May long weekend, my family and I took a trip up to Whistler in British Columbia,

			Canada. We spent the first part of the day driving up there from Seattle, Washington. The

			overall trip took about 7 hours of driving which actually seemed to fly by because of the

			beautiful scenery on the drive up there once you were British Columbia. With only two

			stops, one being for fuel and the other for lunch, I would definitely do the trip again.

			Now onto what happened during our lunch break. We stopped at a little strip mall just off

			of the freeway and grabbed a quick bit to eat from a food truck when are sea of wild

			rabbits came running from out of the bushes. Typically you encounter rabbits and they are

			the first to spring away into the bushes, but this group was clearly out to get something.

			There had to have been about 30 of them on the low end, and this is something that you

			definitely don't see just out in the open, everyday. They shot across the lot, in which

			seemed like a stampede and they vanished before I could begin recording or taking a

			photo of all of them.

			It's not that it was the oddest thing I've ever seen, it's the fact that it happened again,

			twice over the remainder of the weekend is what threw me off. So unless I just haven't

			seen that much wildlife, or this is something that only happens in this area.

			I am seeing if I can find any photos on the internet from someone else who has maybe

			seen this before, and if I do come across any footage, I will be sure to upload again.
