			As most of the readers in the Wildlife Stories community know that I took a trip out to

			Africa last year, which definitely happen to be a life changing trip. Yesterday as I was

			going through photos from that trip, I came across this photo of a crane that I had spotted

			in one of the villages that we stopped off at.

			The reason I felt I needed to share this story, was because of the diversity in the culture.

			Considering when we stopped in this villages, these cranes were amongst humans and

			nobody seems to be bothered or amused, as it was an everyday event for them. Although

			is we come back to reality in North America, something like this is a little odd for us.

			Especially having various wildlife just be apart of our everyday life.

			With that being said, If you ever get the chance to travel to various different parts of the

			world, I would recommend taking a deeper look into the wildlife in those regions, because

			you will definitely be amazed at how different not only the wildlife's habitat can be, but

			how it integrates into a humans life.
